# TUF-on-CI: A TUF Repository and Signing Tool

TUF-on-CI is a secure artifact delivery system that operates on a Continuous Integration
platform. It contains a [TUF](https://theupdateframework.io) repository implementation and an
easy-to-use local signing system that supports hardware keys (e.g. Yubikeys).

TUF-on-CI can be used to publish a TUF repository that contains digitally signed metadata.
Any TUF-compatible download client can use this repository to securely download
the artifacts described in the repository.

This system is highly secure against infrastructure compromise: Even a fully compromised
repository hosting will not lead to compromised downloader clients.

Supported features include:
* Guided signing events for distributed signing
* TUF delegations with signature thresholds
* Signing with hardware keys and Sigstore
* Automated online signing (Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, Sigstore)
* No custom code required

The optimal use case is TUF repositories with a low to moderate frequency of change, both for artifacts and keys.

* The [Sigstore project](https://www.sigstore.dev/) uses tuf-on-ci to manage their TUF repositories in
  [root-signing](https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing) and [root-signing-staging](https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing-staging).
  These repositories are used to deliver the Sigstore root of trust to all sigstore clients.
* GitHub maintains a TUF repository for their
  [Artifact Attestations](https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/)
  with tuf-on-ci
* There is also a [demo deployment](https://github.com/jku/tuf-demo/) for the TUF community
